# BG Killer

BG Killer is a Firefox OS add-on.   
It creates a button for killing all apps in background.

```
One Button to rule them all, One Button to find them,   
One Button to bring them all, and in the darkness bind them [...]
```
   
## Build   

```
$ npm install   
$ gulp   
```

If you do any changes, you may only run `gulp` to rebuild it.   
(`gulp` is only needed to build the extension.zip)   
   
## Install   
You need to use at least __Firefox 43__ WebIDE (actually *Nightly* version) in order to install an add-on.
